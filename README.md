# On the Inefficiency of Efficiency Metrics for Machine Learning Inference

This repo contains code for benchmarking common neural network models in NLP and Computer Vision across various deep learning frameworks and runtime environments (PyTorch, TorchScript).

TODO

- Refactor thop as a git submodule
- Cleanup visualizations notebook
- Remove old experiments
- Refactor requirements.txt to minimal list of dependencies.
- Add support for PyTorch Dynamo, TensorFlow 2, TF-Lite, Jax
